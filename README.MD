Exercise of oriented-object programming.
A app running on Android, is written in C# with Xamarin.

To use, you need a account of HCMUT to login, otherwise it isn't appropriate for you.
So it is only for students studing at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology.

Because it is the first app I made, so it has many issues and bugs.
I try my best to improve it and fix problems.
